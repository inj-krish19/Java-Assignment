-----------------------------------------------------------------

Program - 3 : Implement three classes: Storage, Counter, and Printer.  

∙ The Storage class should store an integer.  

∙ The Counter class should create a thread that starts counting 
from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) and  stores each value in the Storage class.  

∙ The Printer class should create a thread that keeps 
reading the value in the Storage class  and printing it. 

∙ Write a program that creates an instance of the Storage class 
and sets up a Counter and  a Printer object to operate on it. 
Ensure that each number is printed exactly once, by  adding suitable synchronization.
